# Progress Journal
Just a bunch of small projects Iâ€™m working on as I learn and improve. This is my way of tracking progress, building skills, and trying out new stuff.

1. Tic-Tac-Toe <br>
As part of my Semester 2 mini-project, I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java and Swing GUI. It was a fun way to learn about GUIs, buttons, events, and game logic. This small project helped me get hands-on with Java and understand how to make interactive desktop applications. Even though it is a simple project, but it is my first real hands-on experience building something from scratch.
